[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fcavani/e.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fcavani/e) [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/fcavani/e?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/fcavani/e)

This package bring a way to stack the errors for future reference. There is 
tools to retrive the errors from this stack and make decisions during the
run-time. 

It's stable but no use this package. :) I make the e package only for use in my
others go packages, but when I decide
to relise this packages I make e available for compatibility reasons.
